# C Piscine Reloaded

## Introduction

The C Piscine Reloaded is a preparatory project designed to recall and reinforce fundamental concepts of the C programming language before starting the Libft project at Common Core. It focuses on basic syntax, functions, loops, pointers, and memory management.

## Objectives

-   To remeber the basics of C Piscine exercises.
-   Understand and apply basic C syntax and concepts.
-   Work with loops, conditions, and functions.
-   Learn about pointers, arrays, and strings.
-   Practice memory management with `malloc` and `free`.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into multiple exercises, each focusing on specific concepts in C programming. Exercises must be completed in a specific order and adhere to strict coding standards.

### Key Components

-   **ex00**: exo.tar
-   **ex01**: Z
-   **ex02**: clean
-   **ex03**: find_sh.sh
-   **ex04**: MAC.sh
-   **ex05**: "\?$*'MaRViN'*$?\"
-   **ex06**: ft_print_alphabet.c
- ...

## Compilation

Each exercise should be compiled individually using `gcc`. Example:

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror ex06/ft_print_alphabet.c -o alphabet
$ ./alphabet

```

## Coding Standards

-   Use only allowed functions.
-   Follow the Norm coding standard.
-   No global variables.
-   Ensure error handling and proper memory management.

## How to Submit

1.  Complete each exercise in its corresponding directory.
2.  Ensure all files compile without errors.
3.  Follow the submission guidelines provided by 42.
